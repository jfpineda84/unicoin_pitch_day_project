                            <p>We have translated the clunky, bureacratic language of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) into common sense, plain English questions that you can answer with confidence. At Unicoin, we believe that something as important as getting money for college should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or financial literacy. As you answer questions, our smart form uses algorithms to determine any questions you can skip based on your previous responses.</p>
